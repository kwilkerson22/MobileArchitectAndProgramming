Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I developed a weight tracking app using Android Studio. I wanted to allow users to log their weight entries, set a goal weight and easily track their progress. I also added a login/create account screen so that users can securely access and save their data. Users needed the ability to record and view their weight over time. They also needed to be able to set a personal goal weight and receive confirmation through SMS if setting is enabled. They also needed to be able to securely login and create an account to protect their personal data. Lastly, they needed to be able to Logout to keep their account private. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The Login/Create Account screen allows secure access using a username and a password. New users have the ability to make an account on this screen if they didn't have one. The Weight Log screen lets users enter their new weight and see a list of previous entries. The Goal screen allows users to set a goal weight and toggle SMS notificaitons. In all of my screens I used simple layouts to make the app more user-friendly and intuitive. I also tried to make sure to focus on one main action per screen to reduce confusion.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I used a modular approach while coding this app. I structured separate activities for login, weight logging and setting a goal. I tested frequently and focused on building one screen at a time. I will continue to build apps in this manner because it makes debugging less stressful. I will also keep my designs simple and make sure that the task flows make sense. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
After adding new elements to a screen I would test the functionality using the emulator. This is important because it helps narrow downs the sections of code that need to be revised before continuing with the project. For example, I realized at one point in my development process that I needed to fix the intents so that the user can move from screen to screen properly.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In the design stage I initially created too many screens with elements that weren't directly aligned with user needs. Before I continued on to coding my app, I redesigned my screens a second time with an emphasis on simplicity so that users have a great experience on the app. Removing scope creep from my process helped me in later stages of the development process.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience? 
I think I did a good job of incorporating user authentication on the Login/Create Account screen. This will be important in all of my future projects to make sure that private data is protected.
